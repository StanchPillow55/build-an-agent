# Build An Agent

[![CI](https://github.com/StanchPillow55/build-an-agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/StanchPillow55/build-an-agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Welcome to the **Build An Agent Hackathon**! This hands-on workshop teaches you how to create intelligent AI agents that can perform complex tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is an intelligent program that can:

- **Use tools** to perform actions like web searches, API calls, and data processing
- **Maintain conversation context** across multiple interactions
- **Make decisions** about next steps based on available information
- **Handle complex multi-step workflows** autonomously

Unlike simple workflows, agents can adapt to changing requirements, choose tools dynamically, and perform complex reasoning and planning.

## The Educator Agent

The main focus of this project is the **Educator Agent** - an AI-powered curriculum planning tool that demonstrates key agent capabilities:

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

- **Intelligent Curriculum Planning**: Generate comprehensive educational plans tailored to specific grade levels and subjects
- **Content Sanitization**: Built-in PII detection and profanity filtering for safe educational content
- **Multi-format Output**: Create PowerPoint presentations, speaker notes, and complete lesson packages
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Beautiful terminal experience with progress indicators and formatted output
- **Microsoft Integration**: Export directly to OneDrive using Microsoft Graph API

### ðŸ”§ Architecture

The Educator Agent showcases several important agent design patterns:

- **Tool Integration**: Uses multiple tools (OpenAI API, PowerPoint generation, file operations)
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures consistent, reliable output with JSON schema validation
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Applies content policies and age-appropriate filtering
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and robust error management
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage with mocked external dependencies

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/StanchPillow55/build-an-agent.git
cd build-an-agent

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env

# Generate your first curriculum
cd code
python -m educator_agent --grade "8th Grade" --subject "Environmental Science"
```
